        "\n",
        "Answer>In Python, functions can take inputs, known as arguments, which are used to perform specific tasks. Here's a breakdown of function arguments and parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Function Parameters\n",
        "- Parameters are the names listed in the function definition.\n",
        "- They are the variables that receive the input values when the function is called.\n",
        "- Parameters are defined inside the parentheses of the function definition.\n",

        "2. Function Arguments\n",
        "- Arguments are the actual values passed to a function when it's called.\n",
        "- They can be literals, variables, or expressions.\n",
        "- Arguments are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "Answer> Python provides several ways to define and call functions. Here are some of the most common methods:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Defining Functions\n",
        "\n",

        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",

        "\n",
        ". Lambda Functions: These are small anonymous functions that can be defined inline.\n",
        "\n",
        "greet = lambda name: print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        ". Nested Functions: These are functions defined inside another function.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q4.  What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "Answer>The return statement in a Python function serves two purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Exiting the function: When a return statement is encountered, the function immediately stops executing and returns control to the caller.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Returning a value: The return statement can also be used to return a value from the function to the caller. This value can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",

        "\n",
        "- Are objects that can be iterated over, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings.\n",

        "Iterators:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Are objects that keep track of their position during iteration.\n",
        "- Allow iteration over an iterable, one element at a time.\n",
        "- Can be created from iterables using the iter() function.\n",
        "- Can be exhausted, meaning they can't be reused after iteration is complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "Answer>\n",
        "Generators in Python:\n",
        "Generators are a type of iterable, similar to lists or tuples. However, unlike lists, generators do not store all the values in memory at once. Instead, they generate values on-the-fly as they are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining Generators:\n",
        "Generators are defined using a function, but instead of using the return statement, generators use the yield statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "Answer>Generators have several advantages over regular functions, including memory efficiency, lazy evaluation, and flexibility.\n",
        "1. Memory Efficiency: Generators use significantly less memory than regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets. They only store the current state, not the entire dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Lazy Evaluation: Generators only compute values when needed, which can improve performance. They avoid unnecessary computations and only generate values on-the-fly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Flexibility: Generators can be used to create complex sequences and pipelines. They can be combined with other generators, functions, and iterables to create powerful data processing workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "Answer>Lambda Function in Python:\n",
        "A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. It's defined using the lambda keyword.\n",
        "Lambda functions are typically used in the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Processing: Lambda functions are often used with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() to process data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Event Handling: Lambda functions can be used as event handlers, such as responding to button clicks or key presses.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. One-time Use: Lambda functions are ideal when you need a small, one-time-use function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Higher-order Functions: Lambda functions can be passed as arguments to higher-order functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Quick Prototyping: Lambda functions can be used to quickly test an idea or prototype a small function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Sorting and Filtering: Lambda functions can be used as custom sorting and filtering functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Functional Programming: Lambda functions are a key concept in functional programming, which emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data structures.\n",

        "Q9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer>Purpose of map():\n",
        "\n",
        "The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns a new iterable with the results.\n",
